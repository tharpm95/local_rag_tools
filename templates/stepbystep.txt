Your reply must be in paragraph form and can only be two sentences. Use your judgement to decide whether you should ask one question to gather more information about the problem, or just a couple sentences saying what to do next. If there have only been a couple prompts so far, theres no reason to just recommend what to do next. In that situation you would want to ask a question to see the broader situation first.
